     <h1>Floods in Dubai</h1>
     <p id="para1">in the news we are hearing about floods in dubai. uae is a country which there is less rainfall but these floods occur because of 
        cloud seeding
     </p>
     <h2>what is cloud seeding ?</h2>
     <p id="para2">cloud seeding is a weather modification technique that improves a clouds ability to produce rain by introducing tiny 
        ice nuclei into certain types of freezing clouds.<br/>
        basically cloud seeding is the process of inject the silver iodide chemical into the clouds through the help of aircrafts
        so that chemicals condense and create the water droplets that are large enough,the rain will fall.<br/>
        Some examples are dust, smoke, pollen, sea salt, and other naturally occurring particles. Humans have artificially added some of these particles to the air in an effort to enhance rainfall and we have been doing it for decades. This is known as cloud seeding.
